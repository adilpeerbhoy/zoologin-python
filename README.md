Login System for Local Zoo using Python

This is my first bigger Python project I completed for university. The objective was to create a simple login interface for a local zoo. A user would be asked to enter their username and password. Credentials are found in the credentials.json, and the plaintext password entered is checked against the hashed value stored in the file. Users get three attempts to login successfully before the program aborts. Once logged in, users are greeted with another menu and given one of several options based on their role in the system. The program allows for users to logout once finished.
